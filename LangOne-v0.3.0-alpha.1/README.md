## üÜò Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è "WARNING: The data being saved is truncated to 1024 characters"

**This is critical!** The old `setx` method truncated your PATH and may have broken other programs.

**Solution - Restore and Fix:**

```powershell
# Check your current user PATH
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
$userPath

# If it looks wrong/truncated, you may need to restore it from system restore
# or manually re-add missing paths

# To add LangOne correctly (no truncation):
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
if ($userPath -notlike "*C:\LangOne\bin*") {
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$userPath;C:\LangOne\bin", "User")
    Write-Host "‚úÖ LangOne added to PATH successfully (no truncation!)"
}

# Restart PowerShell to see the changes
```

> **Why this happened:** `setx PATH "$env:PATH"` has a 1024 char limit. The new method uses .NET APIs with no limit.

---

### "langone is not recognized as a command"

**Solution:** PATH not set correctly. Try:

```powershell
# Check if LangOne exists
Test-Path C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe

# If true, add to PATH again:
$env:PATH += ";C:\LangOne\bin"
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$userPath;C:\LangOne\bin", "User")

# Then restart PowerShell
```

### Download fails with Invoke-WebRequest

**Solution 1:** Try curl instead (Option 2 in the [Installation Guide](../README.md))  
**Solution 2:** Download manually from GitHub  
**Solution 3:** Check your internet connection  

### Permission denied when creating directory

**Solution:** Choose a different location where you have write permissions, or run PowerShell normally (admin rights not required for C:\LangOne\bin)

### "Unsupported 16-Bit Application" or "not a valid application for this OS platform"

**This means the downloaded file is corrupted or not a proper Windows executable.**

**Solution - Re-download and verify:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Check if the file exists and its size
Get-ChildItem "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe" | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime

# Step 2: Check file type (should show PE32+ executable)
Get-ItemProperty "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe" | Select-Object Name, Length

# Step 3: Delete corrupted file
Remove-Item "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe" -Force

# Step 4: Re-download with verification
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/LangOneOrg/langone-releases/raw/main/LangOne-v0.3.0-alpha.1/bin/langone.exe" `
                  -OutFile "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe" `
                  -UseBasicParsing

# Step 5: Verify download
if (Test-Path "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe") {
    $fileInfo = Get-Item "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe"
    Write-Host "‚úÖ File downloaded successfully: $($fileInfo.Length) bytes"
    Write-Host "üìÖ Downloaded: $($fileInfo.LastWriteTime)"
} else {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Download failed"
}

# Step 6: Test again
langone --version
```

**Alternative: Try curl instead of Invoke-WebRequest**

```powershell
Remove-Item "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
curl.exe -L "https://github.com/LangOneOrg/langone-releases/raw/main/LangOne-v0.3.0-alpha.1/bin/langone.exe" `
     -o "C:\LangOne\bin\langone.exe"
langone --version
```
